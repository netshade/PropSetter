#  Runs all unittests through the iPhone simulator. We don't handle running them
#  on the device. To run on the device just choose "run".
# Controlling environment variables:
#
# GTM_DISABLE_ZOMBIES - 
#   Set to a non-zero value to turn on zombie checks. You will probably
#   want to turn this off if you enable leaks.
#
# GTM_ENABLE_LEAKS -
#   Set to a non-zero value to turn on the leaks check. You will probably want
#   to disable zombies, otherwise you will get a lot of false positives.
#
# GTM_DISABLE_TERMINATION
#   Set to a non-zero value so that the app doesn't terminate when it's finished
#   running tests. This is useful when using it with external tools such
#   as Instruments.
# 
# GTM_LEAKS_SYMBOLS_TO_IGNORE
#   List of comma separated symbols that leaks should ignore. Mainly to control 
#   leaks in frameworks you don't have control over. 
#   Search this file for GTM_LEAKS_SYMBOLS_TO_IGNORE to see examples. 
#   Please feel free to add other symbols as you find them but make sure to 
#   reference Radars or other bug systems so we can track them.
#
# GTM_REMOVE_GCOV_DATA
#   Before starting the test, remove any *.gcda files for the current run so
#   you won't get errors when the source file has changed and the data can't
#   be merged.
