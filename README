PropSetter is an Objective C library for writing XPath/CSS like selectors against your NSObjects, and having those selectors change values in those bjects at runtime.  Expressions look similar to this:

NSString[self = 'The text that it should match']
MyViewController[.stringArray contains 'This string'].title
UIView[.backgroundColor = .foregroundColor].alpha

These expressions follow the basic form:

ClassName[aSeriesOfExpressions].propertyThatWillBeChanged

Expressions may be and'ed and or'ed to each other, like so:

MyViewController[.title = 'Sports' and .dataSource.stale = true].staleIndicatorVisible

The full language is expressed in the selector.grammar file included in the source. Parsing facilities are provided by parsekit (http://parsekit.com/), the lipo'd static lib of which is included with this app. (Revealing the clear iPhone bias of the author. If you happen to patch support for Mac OS compiling into the project, I will happily patch it back into the library.)

Use the PropSetterManager object to allow for these expressions to take action upon your objects. The PropSetterManager object retains your objects as they are observed for changes, using the KVO functionality provided in Cocoa.  For example:

[[PropSetterManager manager] addSelectorFromString:@"UIView[.text = 'Red'].backgroundColor" withValue:[UIColor redColor]];
[[PropSetterManager manager] beginObservingObject:myLabel]

You may also register callback functions to take action whenever a particular property changes, using syntax like the following.

[[PropSetterManager manager] addSelectorFromString:@"NSObject[.text].backgroundColor" withTarget:self andSelector:@selector(changeColorOfObject:)];

To allow for simple rules where NSString, NSData, NSDictionary or NSNumber values are the only values of note to insert into a given object, you may use a property list to add rules to the manager.

[[PropSetterManager manager] addSelectorsFromPlist:filename]
